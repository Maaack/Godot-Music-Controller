# Godot Music Controller
For Godot 4.2

This music controller keeps music playing between scenes and blends tracks.

[Example on itch.io](https://maaack.itch.io/godot-game-template)  
_Example is of [Maaack's Game Template](https://github.com/Maaack/Godot-Game-Template), which includes additional features._

## Use Case
For mainting music playback during scene changes and blending between tracks.

## Features

* Automatically detects and reparents audio streams with a matching audio bus (`Music` by default) and autoplay enabled.
* Allows blending between tracks, and fade-in/fade-out timers.
* Works with Godot's built-in `AudioStreamPlayer`.
* Includes a simple scene extending `AudioStreamPlayer` with the audio bus and autoplay already set.

### How it Works
- `ProjectMusicController.tscn` is an autoload that keeps music playing between scenes. It detects music stream players as they are added to the scene tree, reparents them to itself, and blends the tracks.
